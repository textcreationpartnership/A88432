            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the Petition of <hi>Chriſtopher Syms.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HEE ſaith that there was ſuch a Warrant as is ſet forth in the Petition directed to Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> Knight, then and now Treaſurer at Wars for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the payment of 603 <abbr>l.</abbr> 13 <abbr>s.</abbr> 0 <abbr>d.</abbr> to part of the Train of Artillery, belonging to the Army, of 8000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> raiſed in the yeer 1640. then intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the <hi>Scots:</hi> of which ſumme there was no part thereof mentioned, or intended to be due to the Petitioner, who was onely then appointed a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and Agent, to receive there monies for them: Upon which Warrant this Reſpondent being then Deputy to Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> did at ſeverall times pay unto the Petitioner, and others for the ſaid Train of Artillery: and by directions of the Lords Juſtices and Councell of <hi>Ireland:</hi> the ſumme of 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> or there-abouts, for which the ſaid Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> hath ſeverall Acquittances to produce: unto whom this Reſpondent hath lately given up a full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of all matters then committed to his truſt and charge: And as for the remain of the ſaid Warrant: neither could the ſaid Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> nor the Reſpondent his Deputy, pay the ſame to the Train of Artillery, as was intended; as likewiſe divers other Warrants for great ſummes: for want then of Monies in the Kings Exchequor, the Treaſure being ſo exhauſted by the foreſaid <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army; and that Army being then to bee disbanded, there wanted Monies for that purpoſe: ſo that Sir <hi>Adam Loftus,</hi> to prevent the dangerous conſequence that might ariſe, by thoſe rude and barbarous Souldiers, in their disbanding: Did then ingage himſelf, his eldeſt Son, Sir <hi>Arthur Loftus,</hi> and divers others of his Friends, with this Reſpondent: and took up great ſums of Monies upon their credits, to help to disband them with quietneſſe: which great ſums his Majeſty is to make ſatisfaction for hereafter, and for which the ſaid Sir <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> his Friends, and this Reſpondent are ſtill ingaged, by reaſon the Rebellion there, breaking out ſo ſuddenly, there came in no part of the Kings Revenues of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to diſcharge their foreſaid ingagements, nor many other great ſummes of Monies, disburſed then, and before for the King. This Reſpondent further ſaith, that upon payment of part of the foreſaid ſumme of 603 <abbr>l.</abbr> 13 <abbr>s.</abbr> 0 <abbr>d.</abbr> to the Petitioner, as is aboveſaid, he the ſaid Petitioner did at that time deliver up the foreſaid warrant to this Reſpondent, being neceſſary ſo to doe: that it might be produced before the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Accompts, to paſſe ſo much as this Reſpondent had truely paid thereof, and no more, which Warrant doth remain on Record, in the Office of the Auditor-Generall of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by which the whole truth of this Anſwer may fully appear: And this Reſpondent doth beleeve, that either himſelf or his Servant, did then give the Petitioner a note in writing, declaring what ſummes were then paid to the Petitioner, on the foreſaid Warrant, and what did then reſt unpaid thereof: This Reſpondent alſo ſaith, and is able to make it evidently for to appear, by authentick Records, that hee hath not paſſed any more of the ſaid Warrant on his Accompts, than truely, and <hi>Re-vera,</hi> he hath paid thereof, and for which hee hath Acquittances to produce: Nor hath this Reſpondent taken poundage for any more of the ſaid Warrant, then hee hath truely paid and paſſed in his Accompts, as of right hee ought to doe, and which was juſt and lawfull for him to take: neither did this Reſpondent ever deſire, or intend, or if he were willing ſo to doe; was it in his power to make uſe, advantage, or profit, of the remain of the foreſaid Warrant, which reſts yet unpaid, as is ſuggeſted by the Petitioner: And further, this Reſpondent ſaith, that if the Petitioner have any ſuch Certificate from the Clerk of the Pells, (as hee alledgeth hee hath) it is apparently falſe, or the Clerk is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in very much miſtaken; for that the Petitioner alledgeth his Certificate to bee made about foure or five years ſince, in <hi>July</hi> 1641. at which time the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Warrant was not paſt on any Accompt, untill <hi>May</hi> laſt, 1646. Since which time the Petitioner cannot ſay, that hee had any Certificate thereof from the Clerk of the Pells: And therefore this Reſpondent humbly prayeth, that hee may bee diſmiſſed with ſuch reparations as this Honourable Houſe ſhall think fit.</p>
